in the jungles of the night,\n\
what immortal hand, what eye\n\

In what distant depths or skies\n\
Did the fire in your eyes burn?\n\
On what daring wings did you soar?\n\
What daring hand seized the fire?\n\
\n\
And what shoulder and what art\n\
could twist the fibers of your heart?\n\
And when your heart started beating,\n\
with what fearful hand and with what foot?\n\
\n\
What hammer, what chain,\n\
what oven was your mind in?\n\
On what anvil? What measure of oppression\n\
Dare to embrace the most implacable terror?\n\
\n\
When the stars threw their spears\n\
and the waters of heaven with their tears,\n\
looking at his work, did he smile?\n\
He who made the Lamb, did he make you?\n\
\n\
Tiger, tiger, burning glow\n\
in the jungles of the night,\n\
what immortal hand, what eye\n\
dared to forge your terrible symmetry?");
