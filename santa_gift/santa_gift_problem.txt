description of the problem
In Santa Claus's gift workshop, the CTE (Chief Technology Elf) has decided to implement a new gift classification system,
to facilitate their organization. Each packet now has a unique numeric identifier. The identifier is an integer between 100
and 999, and is used to classify gifts as follows.

If the number is palindrome and odd, the gift corresponds to a girl.
If the number is palindrome and even, the gift corresponds to a child.
If the number is even, but not a palindrome, the gift corresponds to a man.
If the number is odd, but not palindrome, the gift corresponds to a woman.
Write a function that helps the CTE calculate, given a unique gift identifier, what type of person the gift corresponds to.
