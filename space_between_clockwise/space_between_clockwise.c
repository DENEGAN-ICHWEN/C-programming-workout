/*
Create a function that calculates the smallest angle (float) formed between the hands of a clock (hour and minute hands),
 given an hour (int) and minutes (int). The hour will always have a value between 0 and 11, and the minutes a value between 0 and 59.

Help: Remember that the minute hand jumps from minute to minute, while the hour scrolls continuously as the minutes of an hour advance.
