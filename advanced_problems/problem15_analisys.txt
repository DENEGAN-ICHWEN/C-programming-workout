The program works well as the average is calculated in the line (avg += (x - avg)/i) which sums to the past
average the value lacking to get a new averga with a new value entered. It is a pretty efficient and correcto program.

On the other hand, when we enter a very large number, the print shows as a message #INFO+..., so using double, does not work
everytime for finding the average.
