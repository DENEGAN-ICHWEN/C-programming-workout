/*
In a certain city, the fare for a taxi consists of a base fare of 4000 cop, plus 82 pesos for every 100 meters
traveled. Write a function that takes the distance traveled in kilometers (float) as a parameter and
returns the total fare for the trip (int).

Don't forget to round the return (int) value to the nearest integer.
